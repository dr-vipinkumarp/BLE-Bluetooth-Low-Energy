# BLE-Bluetooth-Low-Energy

Bluetooth wireless connectivity technology is based on the IEEE 802.15 standard managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) that is in charge of defining and updating Bluetooth specifications, manages qualification programs and protects the trademarks; ST Microelectronics is a Bluetooth SIG member company. Bluetooth works in the 2.4 to 2.485 GHz unlicensed ISM band and employs techniques including adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) to ensure coexistence with other wireless technologies sharing this overcrowded portion of the RF spectrum. Focused on battery-operated devices such as sensors for health care, sports and fitness and for proximity and security applications, Bluetooth Low Energy, or Bluetooth SmartÂ®, is based on the Bluetooth 4.x and 5.x specifications. ST offers state-of-the-art, easy-to-use Bluetooth Low Energy solutions with systems-on-chip (SoC), baluns and STM32 microcontrollers all supported with a rich evaluation and development environment for cutting time to market.
